# IoT-framework
Building a deep learning-based distributed system with ZeroMQ.
The agent.py and accesspoint.py have to be opened in different terminals and run using the sample code.
The execute method of Agent can be customized according to your need. But always remember the limitations of Tensorflow Keras predict method
in multiple threads.
There is no order in starting the nodes. Any of them can be started first.
The log report will show when a network has been created.
Have fun.
